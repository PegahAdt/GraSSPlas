# Graph-Based Self-Supervised Learning for Repeat Detection in Metagenomic Assembly

This repository contains all necessary code and commands to detect the repeated sequences in a genomic dataset.

Here we propose a novel approach that leverages the assembly graphâ€™s structure through graph neural networks (GNNs) within a self-supervised
learning framework to classify DNA sequences (unitigs) into repetitive and non-repetitive categories.
We frame this problem as a node classification task within the assembly graph.
